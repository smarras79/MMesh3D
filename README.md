MMesh3D
--------
Elliptic, structured grid generator for simply connected domains with real topography:

(Created in 2011. Posted on GitHub in 2020)

##MPI version:
#Option 1 (Recommended): use homebrew to install gcc and openmpi
```
>> brew install gcc openmpi metis
```
Brew will install them in `/opt/homebrew/Cellar` or similar.

#Option 2: Open-MPI 4.1.0 compiled from source with gcc-9

```
>> ./configure --prefix=/MY/PATH/TO/openmpi-4.1.0/build_gcc9/ CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9 F77=gfortran-9 FC=gfortran-9
>> make -j 6 all
>> make install
```

## Compile and run
Tested on Mac OS X and multiple versions of Ubuntu using gcc-4* and later and ifort 8.1

*Compile
```
cd MMesh3D
>> make
```

*Run
```
>> cd MMesh3D/runs
>> mpirun -np 4 ./MMesh3D.a Input_meshparam.inp
```

*Run with GDB debugger:
First make sure that you have the proper debug flags activated in your compilation flags (-g and others)
```
>> cd MMesh3D/run
>> gdb --args ./MMesh3D.a Input_meshparam.inp
>> (gdb) run
```

*Visualization
```
MMesh3D generates a VTK file that can be visualized with ParaView or VisIt.
```

NOTICE: The PDF manual is for V1.0 and still works with the current V2.0 that is in this repo. However, it does not contain information on the elliptic smoothing. 
I will post instructions as soon as I have some spare time.
